My name is Gabriele Degola and I am a fresh graduate in *Data Science and Engineering* from *Politecnico di Torino*, Italy, and *Grenoble INP - Ensimag*, France, where I followed an Erasmus+ double degree lasting 18 months. I conducted my Master's Thesis at [*Neovision*](https://neovision.fr/en/), focusing on the *domain adaptation* problem in computer vision, with title [Approaches for Domain Adaptive Object Detection in Production Environments](http://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/id/eprint/22642).

🎓 **My educations:**
- Master of Science in *Data Science and Engineering* at Politecnico di Torino
- Master of Engineering in *Information Systems Engineering* at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, following a path in *Data Science and Artificial Intelligence*
- Bachelor of Science in *Computer Engineering* at Politecnico di Torino


🛠️ **My coolest projects:**
- A [distributed big data pipeline of book reviews](https://github.com/gabridego/book-reviews-processing), performing word count and sentiment analysis
- Tackled the [incremental learning in image classification](https://github.com/gabridego/MLDL20_Incremental_Learning) problem through clustering and GANs
- A [smart parking](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xyzOMMt3ZT2X23l-SyhueuMNpC89NG3t?usp=sharing) solution to detect free parking spots using deep neural networks and computer vision
- A cool [dashboard of greenhouse gas emission](https://github.com/gabridego/greenhouse-gas-emissions-dashboard) per country and year, based on open data
- Implementation of [kernel methods for image classification](https://github.com/gabridego/kernel-methods)
- Used genetic algorithms to solve the [examination timetabling problem](https://github.com/gabridego/timetabling-problem-solver)
